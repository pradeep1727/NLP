"Lawyers at this law firm ( XXXX ) sent me a letter stating they were hired by this bank ( XXXX ) to prosecute legal proceedings to enforce the security interest, collect a debt on my mortgage. and filed affidavits in court declaring they were hired to collect a debt for this bank and filed an foreclosure in the banks name. This bank never had a loan on my property because it was paid out before the banks merged. About two years after contacting the bank the filed a affidavit stating the bank did not hire nor pay this firm to file the foreclosure. Once I contacted the bank the firm tried to get it dismissed and erased from record.

"In XX/XX/XXXX I filed a police report regarding my wallet being stolen which had money, credit cards, driver 's license, SS card, and checks. I immediately went to my bank and closed the account and reopened a new one and received new checks with a different account number. The person who stole my wallet had used my debit card ... but since it was still pending ... the bank was able to block the withdrawal. I placed a fraud alert on my credit reports and I got a new driver 's license and then ended up getting a XXXX one with my new name since I had married. 
Last week I received a letter from Meade & Associates attempting to collect on a debt from XXXX checks written on my old account with my old drivers license name starting in XX/XX/XXXX. I called and spoke with XXXX XXXX and he agreed that everything was done correctly, I just needed to send him the information from my bank and the police report along with my current drivers license. I requested that he send me copies of the checks that were written, which he did. I went to my bank and they did not have anything specific since nothing actually went through my account at the time. However, they knew I had closed that account and reopened the new one and that I had presented them with a police report. They wrote me a letter to give to XXXX XXXX and I was able to retrieve the police report online. Monday, XXXX XXXX, I faxed both of these documents along with my current drivers license, my actual signature, as well as the new police report number for the case filed with the forgery fraud department. I followed up with a call to XXXX XXXX on Tuesday and was informed he was not available, but they would have him return my call. I called Wednesday afternoon and was then told that he had left early that day without returning my call. I asked if anyone else could help. I was transferred to XXXX. She obtained the documents that I had faxed and I explained to her I wanted to finalize clearing this ordeal. She became hateful and kept saying she needed documents that I she already had. She stated I still needed an affidavit from my bank stating I did not write the checks ... she refused to listen to anything I had to say and acted is if it did not matter what I sent ... it was n't going to make a difference. At that point I definitely became angry and she told me to never call that office again. I called my bank and told them what was going on and they stated that XXXX did not know what she was talking about because the bank never had me sign an affidavit because nothing had actually gone through my account since I had immediately blocked all transactions due to closing the account. The check transactions even clearly say that when they were processed there was no account found. I am currently waiting for my case to be assigned to a detective ... but I am filing reports and claims to help prevent any more aggravation from this company and hope they will learn that you ca n't treat people like criminals when they are the victims in some circumstances ... especially when they present facts and proof.

"I received services from a healthcare provider XXXX years ago. Recently I got a call from a Collection Agency who said the debt has not been paid. The healthcare provider and I were in agreement that they 'd take care of billing but somehow my name was thrown into the mix. The healthcare agency does not respond to my inquiries about the debt or to the collection agency 's inquiries about the debt. This has a possibility of ruining my credit.

"Transunion # XXXXSince I received the letter from XXXX XXXX regarding the complaint listed above I have discovered that this problem has escalated and I believe that I should taking serious action as my rights are being violated. I am outraged at the method of deception which was put into to play last year and is still going. The first thing is the way that they state in the letter that the fraud case issue was denied by their Security Operations dept. Well it was the dept who advised me about the XXXX charge for the refrigerators and they made no mention about the case regarding the fraud was denied, because HD was the XXXX doing the fraud to me. 
In this letter there is no mention about the refrigerator XXXX charge and it also states that they only received XXXX payment of XXXX in XX/XX/2015? ( THAT DATE IS FUTURE ) That payment was made in XX/XX/XXXX along with other payments made to pay the account off in full. They stated that I did not cooperate and provide a declaration for unauthorized use, that is not true as I called to find out why there had been charges made in the months I did not use the card. The c/s XXXX was a rude bias man and he made up the whole story because he was already covering up the fact that there were the bogus charges for the XXXX refrigerator that had APR charges and late fees they could not reverse. He chose not to disclose that information and he was the one who made those negative remarks said to be by me, and now I believe that XXXX have together started providingTRANSUNION with real incorrect information, slandering my name. Transunion sent me XXXX credit files, XXXX saying that there was a error by XXXX and then a XXXX that has trashed my entire credit file and fico score. I called Transunion and told them to remove the fraud alert. They asked for the removal request to be provided in writing and in fact they did the opposite and issued an Extensive Fraud Alert. The strange thing I that the credit file is dated XXXX XXXX 2015 and the personal info is dated XXXX/XXXX/15 and there is a note stating File Blocked for Promotional Purposes. For the revolving accounts they have noted that they are paid as agreed buy it states in bold type "" ADDITIONAL INFORMATION-Credit Card. There are also accounts that they have reported that have been closed per my request and they are not accounts I have had, not to mention a public record I do not know about. They have done this to raise additional flags for my credit history and create problems for any future loans or credit card app. I may request. Well during this dispute the credit dept for XXXX XXXX loaded up my credit file with a great deal of negative information and my FICO score went from XXXX to a XXXX. I ordered my credit report and reported all of this to the XXXX agencies. So I decided to use this XXXX XXXX credit card on XXXX/XXXX/15 and it was only for the deposit of a tool rental and at the register the clerk told me it was declined. I called the number on the card and after stating my card number the automated stated I had a XXXX balance and I was eligible for deferred charging. I asked to speak w/ a rep and he stated that my account was closed per customer request. That was not true I had not requested the account to be closed and the credit report does not make that indication. I believe that this was done in retaliation as I am still receiving emails stating that my account has a XXXX balance and is active, as well as more marketing emails encouraging me to use my account.

"I am trying to deal with Navient ( formerly XXXX XXXX ) regarding private loans that were taken out for my college tuition ( both under my name and with my mother as the primary borrower and myself as the cosigner. ) They have admitted over the phone repeatedly that if you are not giving money to them over the phone ( the exact amount that they want, which is exorbitant, ) they will not document the phone call. Because of this, I have started dealing with them only via paper letters, which they have not taken kindly to. 

For the loans where I am the primary borrower, they are expecting well over $ XXXX/month payments which are unreasonable with my income. I have given them multiple financial statements over the phone, which they apparently are n't putting in the system because the next time I talk to someone there they say that there 's nothing on file. When I give them the statements, they agree that $ XXXX/month is too much, but that they have nothing else available. When I ask what they recommend I do, they say to not even bother sending the amount that I can actually afford without losing my home and car ( needed for my job ) because it 's not enough to do anything worthwhile. Then they make fun of me for not going into the career path that I was hoping to while in college and demand to know when I will be. 

For the loans where my mother is the primary borrower, she has one in a lower payment plan. We have confirmation numbers for the payments and they have been taking them out of her checking account, but then we received a letter in the mail stating that the payment plan has been rejected ( no reason why, which we 're trying to find out in writing. ) Yet even after the date the letter was sent, the money has still been taken out of her account by Navient. She 's also still receiving letters and phone calls that that particular account is delinquent, even though she 's making payments on it. 

I am at my wits end with them, trying to contact them via paper ( I refuse to talk to them on the phone anymore, as it 's resulting in me having panic and anxiety attacks every time they call. ) I do n't want to go into default, but I ca n't afford anything close to what they are demanding for these loans. I have used up all of my forbearance time on these loans ( which I paid {$150.00} every few months to put them into when it was XXXX XXXX. ) It 's almost making me wish that I never went to school at all, and also wish that my school had done a better job educating about what private loans really are instead of having me just sign a piece of paper for more money towards tuition ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX of XXXX. ) My federal loans are in a reasonable repayment plan based on my income ... why can't private loans be the same way? Please help or advise what I can do!

"The option I needed under false statements or representation was not available, but to summarize my complaint, real time resolutions is representing themselves as a mortgage company rather than a debt collection agency on my credit reports with XXXX and XXXX. 

I have a verbal recording that was consented to by them on yesterday XXXX/XXXX/XXXX between XXXX RTR employees, myself, my husband and out financial advisor where they admitted to being a debt collection agency not a mortgage company as they are illegally reporting on my credit report. I have attempted to settle the debt immediately with them if the account classification is corrected but the refuse repeatedly stating that even if I pay them in full they will leave the account on my record incorrectly. 

The property in question was a home I purchased alone in XXXX that became a rental property when my husband and I purchased another home in XXXX. The home was lost due to an illegal foreclosure by XXXX or XXXX as its now known. I attempted to rectify this situation, as my tenant and the XXXX Housing Authority failed to make timely or payments at all in some instances but my only resolve has been the receipt of an {$1100.00} settlement check from a national Class action lawsuit, naming XXXX at fault for the wrongful/Illegal foreclosure. 

As stated before if the only resolve short of litigation is to pay the debt, I have no problem making a settlement to rectify the situation if that is whats necessary to satisfy the XXXX mortgage, but it just does n't seem right that my home was illegally taken, a settlement was paid to me to provide some compensation to my family and now we are again having our credit damaged due to something beyond our control as the collection did not take place right away but approximately 3 years later and because its being reported incorrectly as a mortgage account not a collection account, legally my family is unable to purchase a new home due to the new mortgage laws. Had we known this was a possibility, we never would have sold our last home in XXXX XXXX. Therefore my husband, myself and XXXX children are displaced due to their false representation.

This was AFTER I was assured that I qualified for the forbearance. 

When I called AES to inquire about this, I was told that credit reporting operated on a separate system and that credit reporting was "" automatic, '' but that he would note the situation in my file.

The problem is this. The loans with AES are a consolidated debt of XXXX different loans. When the loans were reported to credit bureau as XXXX days late, my credit scores dropped almost XXXX points for EACH LOAN. That 's approximately XXXX points!!! This is neither fair nor accurate. When payments are made, amounts are applied to each individual loan. The way this is set up, even if XXXX of the XXXX loans is late, ALL XXXX report late. No credit report can sustain and instant XXXX point drop in credit score over something this confusing. 

Like I stated earlier, I am a veteran and a responsible citizen. I struggled to pay the loans on time for the entire XXXX months my husband was out of work. It is not fair that I should have to suffer the insult of a XXXX day late payment due to misinformation that I was given. If I am late making payments due to neglect, then I would feel like I have earned this discredit. However, I was acting on information supplied to me by a company representative. I followed their rules. Therefore, I respectfully ask that the XXXX day late be removed from all XXXX credit bureaus so that we can move on with our lives.

I am requesting that the CFPB require, or simply encourage these companies to provide this service free of charge to American consumers.
