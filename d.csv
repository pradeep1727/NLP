"The debt, XXXX account was settled and paid with a collection Agency, in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, with confirmation numbers and check numbers. I have sent this information to another agency who is trying to collect on the debt, each time I call to verify it 's been taken care of and collection attempts to stop, I keep getting information that is incorrect. The original debt collection agency was XXXX XXXX. I was told on more than XXXX occasion that they could not give me any information because it was archived and they gave me other phone numbers to call. XXXX was the original credit card company and when I called their number the recording stated that they were not taking calls at this time. This was on a Thursday, before XXXX CST. Finally I was able to get in touch with their dispute department, via internet and email, I did get a response that the debt was paid in full along with the account number. I am still having issues with the NEW Collection Firm.

"This isnt my debt

"Equifax refuses to remove erroneous information from my credit report. They said I can put a statement. But whats so funny is the company reporting the information XXXX, XXXX is out of business and they refuse to give me their phone number. 
"
"I have NEVER had a credit card with XXXX XXXX XXXX. This debt is being shopped around to several collection agencies dumb enough to buy it. This is NOT my debt and I will NOT be paying it. 
"
"I have successfully contact the debt collector to arrange my file but i was told that they could not provide me with the information. i was asking to find out what is it that they are charging me for ( invoices, letter, etc ). They did not provide the information for my inquiry.

"Paid for Credit Monitoring, XXXX, {$19.00} per month, XXXX/XXXX/15 called back XXXX/XXXX/15 at approx XXXX : XXXX to cancel and was told that you could not cancel XXXX, they would charge. They would cancel it effective XXXX XXXX. I explained that I did not have a opportunity to really understand what I had signed up for. Since I had a chance to talk to other and realize I already had similar services, I called back to cancel and they said "" TOO BAD ''. I would like my money back.

"I have tried to request my annual credit reports from all three credit reporting agencies. ( XXXX, Experian, & XXXX ). After asking for my general information, and my social security number, date of birth, etc., I was asked XXXX or XXXX questions about my checking account, if a home i currently live in or did live in is in a specific town, if i worked at a certain company, etc. I went through this XXXX ( because it timed out both times ) but the XXXX time I had a problem because I had to look for the deed to my home, to see the exact year it was built, the question was ridiculous. It asked the year it was built, not the approx. year it was built, but the year it was built. I bought the home in XX/XX/XXXX. It was built ( i have since found out ) in XX/XX/XXXX. I knew it was around then, but not exactly that year. The answers to the questions were : XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. I mean, if i was guessing, which is what i would have been doing, it could have gone either way XXXX XXXX??? it ends up i can not get my reports on line now. I am very upset about this. The people generating these questions should think a bit before putting them out there. I recently had to answer a question for my bank and it was about a cousin of mine and if he owned land in some state, I havent even seen him in years. It is ridiculous.

"They are calling upwards of XXXX times a day, often with repeated phone calls occurring within minutes of each other. They are also switching phone numbers every few days, making it very difficult to get them to stop calling. 

In addition this company, despite having called in excess of XXXX times, has never left a single voice mail message. 

Finally, based on the calling pattern and lack of messages, it appears that the company is improperly using automatic dialers ( ie, robo dialing ), which we have never given consent to, putting them in violation of the the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

"originally owed a credit card debt to XXXX XXXX bank back in XX/XX/XXXX that apparently was closed in XX/XX/XXXX an sold to collections for the amount owed {$2500.00}. Was unable at that time to take care of it and thought it was unusually long for them to keep the debt opened for so long before closing it. Am trying to fix credit now but new collector ( midland funding ) is now charging almost double the original amount - {$4000.00}. please help it is the only debt holding me back from succeeding in any business and they are not willing to give any explanations for this old credit card debt.

"They have been calling me XXXX times a day, XXXX every hour on the hour from XXXX to XXXX. Sending mail to my house, looked up my mother, brother and father on public record and called them about my loan, call from a blocked number and have lied about it. Lied to my brother saying I listed him as a reference ( I did not ). Then when I asked how they got the information, they told me they looked it up on public record. I told them it was XXXX, they told me it was not. I have emailed them saying it 's XXXX, yet they continue to call.
