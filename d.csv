"The debt, XXXX account was settled and paid with a collection Agency, in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, with confirmation numbers and check numbers. I have sent this information to another agency who is trying to collect on the debt, each time I call to verify it 's been taken care of and collection attempts to stop, I keep getting information that is incorrect. The original debt collection agency was XXXX XXXX. I was told on more than XXXX occasion that they could not give me any information because it was archived and they gave me other phone numbers to call. XXXX was the original credit card company and when I called their number the recording stated that they were not taking calls at this time. This was on a Thursday, before XXXX CST. Finally I was able to get in touch with their dispute department, via internet and email, I did get a response that the debt was paid in full along with the account number. I am still having issues with the NEW Collection Firm.

"Equifax refuses to remove erroneous information from my credit report. They said I can put a statement. But whats so funny is the company reporting the information XXXX, XXXX is out of business and they refuse to give me their phone number.

"I have NEVER had a credit card with XXXX XXXX XXXX. This debt is being shopped around to several collection agencies dumb enough to buy it. This is NOT my debt and I will NOT be paying it.
