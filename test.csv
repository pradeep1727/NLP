I received services from a healthcare provider XXXX years ago. Recently I got a call from a Collection Agency who said the debt has not been paid. The healthcare provider and I were in agreement that they 'd take care of billing but somehow my name was thrown into the mix. The healthcare agency does not respond to my inquiries about the debt or to the collection agency 's inquiries about the debt. This has a possibility of ruining my credit.,"healthcare, bill, debt, paid, inquiry"

"Experian # XXXXXXXXSince I received the letter from XXXX XXXX regarding the complaint listed above I have discovered that this problem has escalated and I believe that I should taking serious action as my rights are being violated. I am outraged at the method of deception which was put into to play last year and is still going. The first thing is the way that they state in the letter that the fraud case issue was denied by their Security Operations dept. Well it was the dept who advised me about the double charge for the refrigerators and they made no mention about the case regarding the fraud was denied, because XXXX was the XXXX doing the fraud to me. 
In this letter there is no mention about the refrigerator XXXX charge and it also states that they only received XXXX payment of XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX? ( THAT DATE IS FUTURE ) That payment was made in XX/XX/XXXX along with other payments made to pay the account off in full. They stated that I did not cooperate and provide a declaration for unauthorized use, that is not true as I called to find out why there had been charges made in the months I did not use the card. The XXXX XXXX was a rude bias man and he made up the whole story because he was already covering up the fact that there were the bogus charges for the second refrigerator that had APR charges and late fees they could not reverse. He chose not to disclose that information and he was the one who made those negative remarks said to be by me, and now I believe that XXXX have together started providing Experian the real incorrect information, slandering my name. Experian sent me XXXX credit files, XXXX saying that there was a error by XXXX and then a XXXX that has trashed my entire credit file and fico score. I called Experian and told them to remove the fraud alert. They asked for the removal request to be provided in writing and in fact they did the opposite and issued an Extensive Fraud Alert. The strange thing I that the credit file is dated XX/XX/XXXX and the personal info is dated XX/XX/XXXX and there is a note stating File Blocked for Promotional Purposes. For the revolving accounts they have noted that they are paid as agreed buy it states in bold type "" ADDITIONAL INFORMATION-Credit Card. There are also accounts that they have reported that have been closed per my request and they are not accounts I have had, not to mention a public record I do not know about. They have done this to raise additional flags for my credit history and create problems for any future loans or credit card app. I may request. Well during this dispute the credit dept for XXXX XXXX loaded up my credit file with a great deal of negative information and my FICO score went from XXXX to a XXXX. I ordered my credit report and reported all of this to the XXXX agencies. So I decided to use this XXXX XXXX credit card on XX/XX/XXXX and it was only for the deposit of a tool rental and at the register the clerk told me it was declined. I called the number on the card and after stating my card number the automated stated I had a zero balance and I was eligible for deferred charging. I asked to speak w/ a rep and he stated that my account was closed per customer request. That was not true I had not requested the account to be closed and the credit report does not make that indication. I believe that this was done in retaliation as I am still receiving emails stating that my account has a zero balance and is active, as well as more marketing emails encouraging me to use my account. Experian has not agreed to make any changes

They stated that I did not cooperate and provide a declaration for unauthorized use, that is not true as I called to find out why there had been charges made in the months I did not use the card. The XXXX XXXX was a rude bias man and he made up the whole story because he was already covering up the fact that there were the bogus charges for the second refrigerator that had APR charges and late fees they could not reverse. He chose not to disclose that information and he was the one who made those negative remarks said to be by me, and now I believe that XXXX have together started providing Experian the real incorrect information, slandering my name. Experian sent me XXXX credit files, XXXX saying that there was a error by XXXX and then a XXXX that has trashed my entire credit file and fico score. I called Experian and told them to remove the fraud alert. They asked for the removal request to be provided in writing and in fact they did the opposite and issued an Extensive Fraud Alert. The strange thing I that the credit file is dated XX/XX/XXXX and the personal info is dated XX/XX/XXXX and there is a note stating File Blocked for Promotional Purposes. For the revolving accounts they have noted that they are paid as agreed buy it states in bold type "" ADDITIONAL INFORMATION-Credit Card. There are also accounts that they have reported that have been closed per my request and they are not accounts I have had, not to mention a public record I do not know about. They have done this to raise additional flags for my credit history and create problems for any future loans or credit card app. I may request. Well during this dispute the credit dept for XXXX XXXX loaded up my credit file with a great deal of negative information and my FICO score went from XXXX to a XXXX. I ordered my credit report and reported all of this to the XXXX agencies. So I decided to use this XXXX XXXX credit card on XX/XX/XXXX and it was only for the deposit of a tool rental and at the register the clerk told me it was declined. I called the number on the card and after stating my card number the automated stated I had a zero balance and I was eligible for deferred charging. I asked to speak w/ a rep and he stated that my account was closed per customer request. That was not true I had not requested the account to be closed and the credit report does not make that indication. I believe that this was done in retaliation as I am still receiving emails stating that my account has a zero balance and is active, as well as more marketing emails encouraging me to use my account. Experian has not agreed to make any changes

"Experian # XXXXXXXXSince I received the letter from XXXX XXXX regarding the complaint listed above I have discovered that this problem has escalated and I believe that I should taking serious action as my rights are being violated. I am outraged at the method of deception which was put into to play last year and is still going. The first thing is the way that they state in the letter that the fraud case issue was denied by their Security Operations dept.
